This personal fork was abandoned in favor of more-robust / upstream solutions.
If you have any desire to see history or the original files housed by this
repository, check out the branch, supported-before-linux-4.6.1-2-ARCH, or look
backwards in history of master.

I may pick this project back up in the future if it's ultimately found to be
the lesser of all evils for broadcom support ;-).

Final commit message on that branch with some more info:

    MARKER - support for circa linux-4.5.{something}
    
    This marks the baseline which worked for the ARCH linux version prior to
    the linux-4.6.1-2-ARCH upgrade. (Without looking into the exact version,
    I believe it was circa linux-4.5.{something}).
    
    This codebase is being abandoned in favor of more-robust / upstream
    solutions.
    
    Users of this project may look into AUR-provided solutions, as one
    possible alternative.
